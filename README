CL-Etsy bridges from Common Lisp to version 1 of the Etsy.com API[2].  It is an asdf[1].  Once loaded the common lisp package "ETSY" exports one routine for each method in the API, and classes for user, shop, listing, and api-method.

The names used in the API specification use two spelling conventions.  Camel case is sued for method names, e.g. getUserDescription.  In cl-etsy these are converted to the usual lisp spelling, e.g. get-user-description.  Underscores are used for field names, e.g. user_name.  In cl-etsy these are converted to the usual Lisp spelling, e.g. user-name.
