- Build-method should be teased out into a seperate file.

- The functions manifesting the API should be methods on
  an object that can manage the connection (throttle, cache,
  etc.)  That would also allow methods on the classes to
  fall thru to the raw API calls.

- Need a theory of detail-levels and caching.

- An example would be polite.

- Doc is always nice.

- The error handling needs love, as it all fails just invoke error.
